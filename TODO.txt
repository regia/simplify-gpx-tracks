TODO show in the console length of the tracks

TODO investigate possibility to choose tolerance based on the length of the track and the number of points. With diff length of coordinates and length of track need diff tolerance.
for example for coordinate like 36.232 enough tolerance = 0,1 but for coordinate 36.25883873552084 need tolerance at least 0,0001
