TODO show in the console length of the tracks
TODO investigate possiblity to choose tolerance based on the length of the track and the number of points. With diff length of coordinates and length of track need diff tolerance.
for example for coordiate like 36.232 enough tolerance = 0,1 but for coordinate 36.25883873552084 need tolerance al least like 0,0001
