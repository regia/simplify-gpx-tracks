simplify-gpx-tracks
===================

Script for simplifying gpx tracks. Based on [simplify.py](<https://github.com/omarestrella/simplify.py>). 
Now is working only for GPX. But it is possible to create parsers for another track files like OZI or KML.

**Dependencies**:

* Python 2.7.x
* lxml


How it works?
-------------

Just run script in console with path to the gpx file(s)

  >python run.py /home/user/GPX
  
or

  >python run.py d:\\tracks
